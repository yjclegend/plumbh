length change according to height

    height measurement according to a fixed point


inner params and distortion coeffients change with focal length change

estimate size with tilt

A novel camera distortion model and plumbline based distortion calibration

model for simulation of estimation error(pixel and normal),relaxations are applied based on errors
the actual model might be too hard to estimate, so relaxation is better

cross validation on a set of lines


when the distance changes, the focus ring will be adjusted, so the image range is changed

plumbline based camera distortion calibration simulated with improved camera model
